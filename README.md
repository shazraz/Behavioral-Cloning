# Behavioral-Cloning
Autonomous driving in a simulator using a convolutional neural network.

This project uses the Udacity Self-Driving Car simulator located [here](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim) to collect training data for a neural network. The data is then used to train a convolutional neural network to autonomously navigate the vehicle around the track. Details of the network and methodology are provided in the project write-up [here](https://github.com/shazraz/Behavioral-Cloning/blob/master/writeup.md)
